The code starts with an event listener to the DOMContentLoaded event. To ensure that the JavaScript code runs only after the HTML code has been loaded.
It selects the form and other input fields from the HTML using getElementById. This includes the form , username, email, password, and confirm password inputs.
Two functions showError and clearError, are used to handle error:
showError - This function displays an error message for a specific field by displaying the text content of the corresponding error element.
clearError - This function clears the error message for an input field by setting the text content of the error element to an empty string.
validateUsername(): Checks if the username field is empty and displays an error message if necessary.
validateEmail(): Validates the email field by checking for an empty value and matching to a regular expression to verify the email format. 
validatePassword(): Validates the password field for it being empty and minimum length. 
validateConfirmPassword(): Validates the confirm password field by checking for it being empty and matching it with the password. 
Event listeners are added to each input field (username, email, password, and confirm password) with the event type 'blur'.
An event listener is added to the form element (form) for the 'submit' event , which prevents the default form submission. 
All the functions are called at the end to check if all the fields are valid.
